A clean simple BitTorrent client

![]()

## Issue to solve
Current popular clients are made primarily for advanced users.
They include features that most people don't need.
Some have ads and some haven't changed UI since they were released.

## Design
- Dark theme
- Clean and modern
- VS code inspired look

## Required features
- Shortcuts for pause, start, open in folder, and delete any torrent.  
  Up down with j/k, spacebar to pause/start
- Manage torrent files such as priority and only downloading partially
- Reliable torrenting backend library, torrent-stream looks promising
